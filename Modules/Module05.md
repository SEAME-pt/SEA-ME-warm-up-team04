## Exercise 00 : Mandelbrot Multithreading
> Fractal is one of the fields of mathematical and geometric research, and refers to a geometric structure with self-similarity. To put it simply, it is a study of a figure in which the entire shape is repeated equally when a small part of a figure is enlarged.

> The term fractal was first used by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1974, A fractal is an abstract mathematical object, like a curve or a surface, which has a similar pattern whatever the scale.

> Welcome to the final! In this Module you don't need to type code by yourself. But It would be difficult more than previous.

- In this project, read this example : [Mandelbrot Example in Qt](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtcore-threads-mandelbrot-example.html)

- Understand the whole example code. You must explain Mandelbrot in the evaluation.

- Of course, you have to be able to explain the equation.
- But... That all. Good luck!
