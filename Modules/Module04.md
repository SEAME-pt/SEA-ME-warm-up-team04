## Exercise 00 : Graphical Phonebook
> Isn't it too boring to just look at the dull terminal? Letâ€™s make a Cool, Pretty, and Sexy application!!
> Get out your memory of the phonebook that you made in Module 00. Itâ€™s time to level up the phonebook. In this section, you would use Qt Creator.
- Follow these steps:
    1. Make Qt Quick application
    2. Use the qml file to draw a phonebook.
    3. Save data with c++ code.
- Your phonebook work like Module 00. But this time the commands(ADD, SEARCH, REMOVE, BOOKMARK, EXIT) should work with button clicks. Only to get new contact data could use the keyboard.
